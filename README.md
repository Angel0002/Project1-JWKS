JWKS Server

This project is a simple Python-based server that provides JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint for testing and development purposes. It uses the Flask web framework for handling HTTP requests and generates JWTs using RSA keys. This project was created with the use of ChatGTP as permitted by the syllabus. The specific use of ChatGTP was to acquire how a private RSA key is generated, in addition to research regarding the requirements of this assignment.
